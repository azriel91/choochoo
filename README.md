`choochoo` is a library that supports building operations tools with good user experience.

**Note:** This is still in early development, so expect frequent API breakages.

See:

* [`MOTIVATION.md`](MOTIVATION.md) for the motivation to create this library.
* [Operations UX](https://azriel.im/ops_ux/) for a book about the dimensions considered during `choochoo`'s design and development.
* The [examples](examples) directory for usage examples.
